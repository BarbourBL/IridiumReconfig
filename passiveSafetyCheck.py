ROE-based Passive Safety Validation Technique

AUTHOR: Bruce L. Barbour, 2023

This Python script encompasses the ROE-based Passive Safety validation technique using
the 2-D projected RC-plane (RIC frame) ellipse of a relative orbit and a keep-out
volume (KOV) centered about a Client spacecraft. These ellipse models are described 
by relative orbital elements (ROE) in the quasi-nonsingular form derived by 
Simone D'Amico, Ph.D.. 

The proposed ROE-based Passive Safety Technique (RPST) is composed of two 
independent sets of necessary and sufficient conditions used to determine
spacecraft passive safety in the context of maintaining integrity of the driving
KOV. Only ONE of these two sets must hold true to satisfy the condition of passive
safety.

    (i) The first set of conditions is a Radial Buffer, specifically a minimum
        radial separation between the KOV and Servicer spacecraft's relative motion.
        In the case of a projected relative orbit in the RC-plane modeled as a 2-D 
        ellipse, the head and/or tail of the ellipse must not connect with the KOV. 
        

        This can be accomplished by ensuring the following condition:

        
            ->  SMA_c*|da| - SMA_c*de > R_KOV

        
        where 'SMA_c' is Client semi-major axis, 'da' is relative semi-major axis,
        'de' is relative eccentricity vector magnitude, and 'R_KOV' is the radius
        of the driving KOV in the radial direction. For completeness, the enclosed 
        bracket '||' is an absolute value bracket.

        
        This condition is necessary AND sufficient. Note that this condition is
        applicable to other forms of relative motion outside of those exhibiting
        an 'elliptical nature'.


    (ii) The second set of conditions is ellipse-centered, in other words, the
         projected RC-plane relative orbit MUST closely resemble a closed ellipse.
         Most often, projected RC-plane orbits will exhibit an elliptical shape
         if the relative eccentricity and inclination vectors are not orthogonal,
         i.e., |atan2(dey, dex) - atan2(diy, dix)| ~= Ï€/2.

        (ii)(a) First condition of the second set guarantees that the 2-D projected
                relative orbit is larger than the KOV. This assumes that a Radial
                Buffer is not observed, thus the imaginary center of the relative 
                orbit is either near or coincident with the Client spacecraft
                position, modeled as the origin in the RIC frame. Ensuring that the
                relative orbit's projected ellipse does not breach the KOV requires
                its semi-major and semi-minor axes extending outside of the KOV 
                radial and cross-track dimensions.

                
                This can be expressed mathematically:

                
                    ->  min(aRC, bRC) > C_KOV
                    ->  max(aRC, bRC) > R_KOV

                
                where 'aRC' and 'bRC' are the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the
                2-D projected ellipse of the relative orbit. The term 'C_KOV' is
                the radius of the driving KOV in cross-track direction. 

        (ii)(b) Second condition of the second set guarantees that no intersection
                exists between the 2-D projected relative orbit and the KOV. This also
                extends to points of contact and/or complete overlap. Compared to the
                first condition in the second set, this condition has higher
                complexity by involving root solver or root behavior estimation
                methods. Therefore, modeling the 2-D projected ellipses of the
                relative orbit and KOV will need to be performed, which the Python
                script 'rpstUtilities.py' provides the necessary pieces.

                Multiple root solver and root behavior estimation methods can be
                utilized to check for intersection. The supplemental Python script
                supplies the depressed quartic function, quartic discriminant, and
                depressed quartic coefficients needed for most, if not all, of the
                methods.

                The methods that will be written as part of the passive safety
                validation algorithm include:

                (1) Nature of Quartic Roots (E.L. Rees)
                (2) Newton-Raphson Method
                (3) Sturm's Theorem
                (4) NumPy PolyRoots (Python library)
                (5) SciPy Optimize f-Solve (Python library)
                (6) Polynomial Conic Intersrction Test (Fitzgerald)

        Both of these conditions MUST be satisfied to be necessary AND sufficient. It
        is possible to have the first condition of the second set be true, but the 
        second of the set to be false (and vise-versa). The reason is that a centered 
        radial separation can exist in the projected RC-plane where a tilt angle can 
        induce ellipse intersection. However, it can be said that having the first 
        condition of the set is definitive since the geometric size of relative orbit 
        being smaller than the KOV, by definition, directly violates passive safety.

Error corrections are introduced to account for floating point and round-off errors in
computation. Additionally, negligible values (i.e., values very close to zero) are
carefully considered by implementing a hard-coded zero-offset via heuristic approach.
